FollowTheBall is a quick, feel‑good game about focus and reaction.

A small black ball darts across the screen. Your task is simple: tap it to catch it. Each clean catch freezes the ball for a heartbeat and adds one more point to your score. Reach the target, and the level is yours.

The first levels are calm and inviting. As you progress, the pace rises, the motion grows livelier, and every successful tap feels like a tiny victory. Short rounds make it perfect for a spare minute, yet the gentle challenge keeps pulling you back for “just one more try”.

What you’ll enjoy:
- Clear, relaxing visuals with a smooth gradient backdrop
- Satisfying moment of stillness after every catch
- A sense of progress: levels unlock, goals increase, best scores improve
- Lighthearted screens for statistics, achievements, and rewards

FollowTheBall is a pocket‑sized focus exercise: warm, friendly, and endlessly replayable.
